# lisp-spels
Casting SPELs in LISP â€” A simple text adventure game in Emacs Lisp, or elisp.
Heavily based on [Casting SPELs in LISP](https://www.lisperati.com/casting-spels-emacs/html/casting-spels-emacs-1.html).

You can use `(help)` to see which spells you can conjure, and you can use `(explain <spell>)`, e.g. `(explain look)` for a description of what each spell does.
There is a way to win the game, and a way to lose it. Have fun!
